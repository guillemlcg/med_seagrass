## Troubleshooting

### App won't start?
- Make sure you're in the `panel` folder
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip list | grep streamlit`
- Try: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

### Can't see images?
- Images should be in `../img/` folder
- Check that the folder contains: posidonia.jpg, cymodocea.jpg, zostera.jpg, halophila.jpg, ruppia.jpg

### Data not loading?
- Verify `../data/pres_abs_merge_def.csv` exists
- Check file path in `app.py` if you moved files

### Port already in use?
- Streamlit default port is 8501
- Use: `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`

## System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest versions)

## Performance Notes

- First load may take a few seconds (data caching)
- Subsequent page switches are fast (cached data)
- Large correlation matrices may take 2-3 seconds to render
- Geographic maps load from OpenStreetMap
